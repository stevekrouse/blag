I have some items burning a hole on my to-do list, so instead I made my [reading list](/library) queryable via SQL.

Hit the **I'm Feeling Lazy** button if you're not feeling especially structured in your queries.

## What's going on here, exactly?

I keep my reading list in a Google Sheet. Here's what I looks like (...it's just a spreadsheet). 

![Book List](/img/sql-reading-list/spreadsheet.png)

For a while, I was relying heavily on Goodreads for my reading data, but now I'm doing my best to live up to Tom MacWrite's [Indie Bookshelves guidance](/https://macwright.com/2022/02/24/indie-bookshelves.html), though, like he suggests, I'd ideally love to have some sort of [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) (Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere) setup going.

As you may have noticed (if you squinted), I'm still behind in inputting all of my "data" (the *is_fiction* and *is_reread* columns are still not fully populated). Also adding new entries is still painfully manual, which needs further thinking.

But - the key thing here - this reading list is already good/useful enough for an experimental library feature!

## ROAPI

My friend QP is a genius and the best programmer I know (hi, QP!). One of his most recent projects is called [ROAPI](https://roapi.github.io/docs/index.html) (read-only API). Here's how he describes it:

```markdown
ROAPI automatically spins up read-only APIs for static datasets without requiring you to write a single line of code. It builds on top of Apache Arrow and Datafusion. The core of its design can be boiled down to the following:

* Query frontends to translate SQL, GraphQL and REST API queries into Datafusion plans.
* Datafusion for query plan execution.
* Data layer to load datasets from a variety of sources and formats with automatic schema inference.
* Response encoding layer to serialize intermediate Arrow record batch into various formats requested by client.
```

He even made a diagram:

I've been looking for excuses to use ROAPI (I even started learning Rust this month so that I could help contribute to the project. So far, I've made a few measly PRs to ROAPI, but I also got distracted by learning how to make a Dungeon Crawler 2D game in Rust - which you can even [play online](https://whatrocks.github.io/rusty-dungeon/) via WASM!).

ROAPI already supports Google Sheets as a datasource, so this tutorial is pretty much already done. The magic of ROAPI is that there's no bespoke code I need to write - all I need to do is set up its config file to point to my Google spreadsheet and I've got a fast API server that can perform bi-directional communication in JSON, SQL, or GraphQL. Which is insanely cool.

I just needed somewhere to host ROAPI. QP provides a pre-built Docker image as well as via a Python package. My first thought was to host on a free Heroku dyno, but I had some trouble getting their dynamic PORT env variable to work correctly (despite me adding support in ROAPI to set the PORT via env vars, which I tested and confirmed works! Oh, well.)

My next idea was to do something I'd been meaning to do for a while - check out Replit's "always-on" REPL mode.

## Replit

I've written before about [my love for Replit](/computers-by-the-decade). 

Here's how I got my ROAPI setup on Replit
* Create a Python repl (make it Private, so you need to be on their $7/month Hacker plan)
* Install "roapi-http" in packages tab
* Create a file: "roapi.yaml" with these contents

```yaml
tables:
  - name: "library"
    uri: "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FCKSd4GBZIOe-bQG7k7Y3oA_MqMrxEx0QDzdkrkzIgI/edit"
    option:
      format: "google_spreadsheet"
      application_secret_path: "ohsheet.json"
```

* Create another file called "ohsheet.json" (or whatever you put in your config file) with your Google Sheets creds (remember this REPL needs to be private). Follow QP's [Google Sheets guide in the ROAPI docs](https://roapi.github.io/docs/config/dataset-formats/gsheet.html) for instructions of how to get these creds. Feature request for Replit: it would be nice if there were a (hacky) way to read Replit's "Secrets" (env vars) in a YAML file, so that I didn't have to do this.
* Update "main.py" with these contents:

```python
import subprocess
import os

my_env = os.environ.copy()
my_env["HOST"] = "0.0.0.0"

process = subprocess.Popen(
  [
    'roapi-http',
    '-c',
    './roapi.yml'
  ],
  env=my_env,
  stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
  universal_newlines=True,
)

while True:

  output = process.stdout.readline()
  print(output.strip())
  
  return_code = process.poll()
  if return_code is not None:
    print('RETURN CODE', return_code)
    for output in process.stdout.readlines():
        print(output.strip())
    break  
```
* Hit Run at the top and we're done! I can see my logs in the bottom right corner for any incoming requests. Replit's like being able to SSH into your API server and make random changes at will - dangerous AND fun!

My API is public, so anyone can give this a shot in their terminal (why not try out the GraphQL endpoint?):

```bash
curl -X POST -d "query { library(limit: 10) {title, amazon_link, author, is_favorite} }" https://roapi-library.whatrocks.repl.co/api/graphql

[{"title":"Heir to the Empire","amazon_link":"https://amzn.to/3r38doD","author":"Timothy Zahn","is_favorite":false},{"title":"Dark Force Rising","amazon_link":"https://amzn.to/3pXfpkE","author":"Timothy Zahn","is_favorite":false},{"title":"The Making of Prince of Persia","amazon_link":"https://amzn.to/2Pcc7gE","author":"Jordan Mechner","is_favorite":false},{"title":"Butcher's Crossing","amazon_link":"https://amzn.to/3kvbGtz","author":"John  Williams","is_favorite":true},{"title":"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!: Adventures of a Curious Character","amazon_link":"https://amzn.to/2MxqkUu","author":"Richard P. Feynman","is_favorite":false},{"title":"This Boy's Life","amazon_link":"https://amzn.to/3r8gqru","author":"Tobias Wolff","is_favorite":true},{"title":"The Once and Future King","amazon_link":"https://amzn.to/2NErKgH","author":"T.H. White","is_favorite":false},{"title":"The Knight","amazon_link":"https://amzn.to/3bLgUNH","author":"Gene Wolfe","is_favorite":false},{"title":"Birds Without Wings","amazon_link":"https://amzn.to/3r5oQQi","author":"Louis de Berni√®res","is_favorite":false},{"title":"Cryptonomicon","amazon_link":"https://amzn.to/2O402cV","author":"Neal Stephenson","is_favorite":false}]
```

I have no idea what happens if this endpoint gets hammered. Maybe Replit just turns it off? Regardless, I enabled their "Always On" feature, as well as "Boosted" which gives my REPL some extra compute juice.

## No, 'drop table library' does not work

Cause it's "read only", remember?

My library is up and running and you can [try it out](/library) now. I even added a consistent query param with the SQL query so that I could share links to books about [Writing](/library/?sql=select+author%2C+title%2C+cover_url%2C+amazon_link+from+library+where+topic+%3D+%27Writing%27+order+by+year_read+desc%3B) or [my favorite books about ancient Rome](/library/?sql=select+author%2C+title%2C+cover_url%2C+amazon_link+from+library+where+is_favorite+%3D+true+and+topic+%3D+%27Ancient+Rome%27+order+by+year_read+desc%3B), for example. I used a bunch of "vanilla JS" to make this work, given that my blog is a static site built with Syte / EJS, so there was a lot of googling for `XMLHTTPRequest` docs.

Some things I'm going to think about more, next time I'm procrastinating:

- [ ] Automatically trigger daily restarts of the REPL so that I can get an updates to the spreadsheet (ROAPI does not yet dynamically re-load contents, it only does so one time, at the beginning)
- [ ] Finish up adding the remaining fields/data to the spreadsheet, maybe while re-watching Halt and Catch Fire.
- [ ] I can't seem to get doubly-nested `group by` SQL queries working, maybe I can look into this on the ROAPI side
- [ ] Add WASM support to ROAPI so that I don't need a server at all
