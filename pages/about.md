Hello! My name is Charlie Harrington. I'm a computer programmer and writer living in San Francisco, California. I grew up in Red Bank, New Jersey. Here's a grainy photo of me playing *Let It Be* on banjo:

### Projects

#### Active

* [Fahrenheit 52](https://f52.charlieharrington.com) - a weekly writing challenge for 2022 inspired by Ray Bradbury
* [In The Troll Pit](https://ittp.charlieharrington.com) - livestream adventures in retro computing
* [Writes With](https://writeswith.com) - nerdy interviews with writers about their tools

I'm also ~~writing~~ ~~editing~~ re-editing a novel about robots. If you like adventures and being a kid and summer reading and box fans, then this could be the book for you!
