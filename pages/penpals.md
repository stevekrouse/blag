Here's a new Terminal Man track from my most recent flight to Newark. I've been watching a lot of Stranger Things, if you can't already tell.

This is the first Terminal Man song I've hosted on YouTube instead of SoundCloud. Slightly annoying to have to make a movie out of the mp3 before uploading, but I do like my iMovie Star Wars crawl thing going on here. And I feel more confident that dropping stuff onto YouTube is like putting it into an Indiana Jones-style vault or time capsule that won't ever go away or shut down.
