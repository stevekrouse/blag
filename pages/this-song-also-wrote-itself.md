Careful readers of this site may recall that I'm the first person in the history of the world to [play guitar and sing a song in the back of a self-driving car](/found-myself-driving) (TODO: insert "prove me wrong" meme here).

Well, friends, my "talents" were requested again by [Cruise](https://getcruise.com).

Thank you to my pal [Paul Rosevear](https://paulrosevear.com/) for the blues-y, groovin' strummin' tips last week (please teach me more guitar stuff)! Thanks also to the great Chuck Berry (all albums should probably include this thank-you)! And thanks to Carly for tolerating all the practicin' I've been doing in preparation (and also for the bouncy-ball lyrics idea in the video)!

Music is the best!
