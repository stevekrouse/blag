Last night I got to ride in my first driverless [Cruise](https://getcruise.com) car (adorably named Cheddar) and I brought along my guitar.

Lyrics, for the record:

```
Hop into the back seat
It's time for a ride
Tonight we're Cruisin'
Yeah, let's autonomously drive

There's no one behind the wheel
But it keeps on turning
I still can't believe this thing is real
and it's continuously learning

I found myself driving in a self driving car
I found myself driving in a self driving car

I use a laser beam to find my way to you
I use a laser beam to deliver lots of food

I found myself driving in a self driving car
I found myself driving in a self driving car
```

I'm assuming this is the first ever song performed in a driverless car. We're making history over here at Cruise.

Other than the song, the ride was unremarkable insofar as it just felt normal, even though there was no one behind the wheel. The whole experience was a weird blend of `this is amazing` and `this is an everyday thing`, if that makes sense. I'm excited for more people to get to use Cruise soon!
