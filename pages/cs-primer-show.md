Straight from the Nand Cave and also somewhere else comes [The CS Primer Show](https://www.youtube.com/@cs_primer). 

Here's episode one, where Oz and I meander around Richard Hamming's excellent talk [You And Your Research](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html).

Subscribe to the YouTube channel for future episodes. You can expect a whole lot of Bell Labs content. Also check out Oz's new educational venture [CS Primer](https://csprimer.com) - it's like having your own personal Aristotle-Oz computer science tutor and I'm loving it!
